TECH CYCLE - SIGNUP ISSUE DOCUMENTATION
==========================================

Date: October 18, 2025
Status: SIGNUP NOT WORKING

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
==================
The user registration/signup functionality is currently not working properly.

ERROR DETAILS:
==============
- Frontend shows "Failed to fetch" error on signup page
- Backend server is not running or not accessible
- User tried to run "node server.js" from root directory but server.js is in backend folder

ROOT CAUSE:
===========
The backend server is not running, which causes the frontend to fail when trying to connect to the API endpoints.

CURRENT STATUS:
===============
✅ Database: Neon.tech PostgreSQL - Connected and working
✅ Code: All migration completed and pushed to GitHub
✅ Frontend: Updated to use database-only (no localStorage fallbacks)
❌ Backend Server: NOT RUNNING

SOLUTION NEEDED:
================
1. Start the backend server from the correct directory:
   - Navigate to: cd backend
   - Run: node server.js
   - OR use: node backend/server.js from root directory

2. Verify server is running on port 5000
3. Test signup functionality

FILES AFFECTED:
===============
- backend/server.js (main server file)
- src/pages/Register.js (signup page)
- src/services/api.js (API calls)
- src/context/AuthContext.js (authentication context)

TECHNICAL NOTES:
================
- Server should show: "Server is running on port 5000"
- Database connection should show: "✅ Connected to Neon PostgreSQL database successfully!"
- All signups will go directly to Neon.tech PostgreSQL database
- No localStorage fallbacks (removed for clean database-only operation)

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Start backend server
2. Test signup with new user credentials
3. Verify user is created in Neon.tech database
4. Document resolution
